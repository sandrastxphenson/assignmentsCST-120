<h2>About Me</h2> <!--title-->
<p>
  My name is Sandra Rodriguez (technically Stephenson), I am 21 and was born and raised in Riverside, CA.
  I attended San Diego State University in 2018. I studied in San Diego for 2 years and then decided
  to move to Europe for someone I had just met (and am now married to). For this reason, I am now
  pursuing an online degree in software development from GCU!
