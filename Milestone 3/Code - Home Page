<h2>About Me</h2>
<br>My name is Sandra Rodriguez and I am 21 years old. I was born in Riverside, CA; however, I moved to San Diego, CA in 2018
    in order to pursue my academic career at San Diego State University. Three years into my academic career at SDSU, I decided
    to move to Europe and pursue an online degree. After 1 year in Spain and Portugal, I currently reside in San Diego, CA and
    may be moving to Costa Rica in the near future! </br>

    My main hobbies include reading, going to the gym, and watching Naruto. I also enjoy going kayaking, paddle boarding, and
    the salty air at the beach. Even as a current GCU student, I have yet to step foot in Arizona, but I hope to change that 
    one day!
